**ChangeLog**
-----------------------
9-26-2015 - v1.2.0_Build_006
  Added option to not have trees have an effect on wind like the game normally does.
  When option is enabled we redirect WindManager.CalculateSelfHeight(), and inside there in our version
  if option enabled we don't add the height of the tree to the terrain in a given area 
  to the height for the windcell.

9-25-2015 - v1.2.0_Build_005
+ reverted calculation bug in calculate Area height introduced with the prior source code fkup
  bug was difference between something being converted from float to int and back in CalculateAreaHeight().

9-25-2015 - v1.2.0_Build_004
+ Just a display name\title change from Trees Unlimiter 1.1 to Unlimited Trees Mod; internally namespace and such is
  unchanged though.

9-24-2015 - v1.2.0_Build_003
  Recovery\rebuilding of build002 due to source code fkup on my part and lost all AD changes.


9-20-2015 - v1.2.0_Build_002 
Afterdark patch update 
+ Recompiled for Afterdark update; however prior version should still work.

+ Found the root of the -1\0 tree item bug in editors that I had previously manually hacked around, 
  disabled that hack around code. Fix was a certain deserialize related line from the original that started
  at 0 instead of 1 for one of loops.

+ Split out and now re-direct calls to TreeManager.FinalizeTree() to our own. 
  Previously our ReleaseTreeimplementation() carried all the finalizetree() code inside itself instead of calling
  out... I don't know why that was originally done but for now unless there is a problem I've sperated it out
  to it's own proper redirected function.  Maybe back in 1.0.0.0 of CSL C\O had it all combined.
  I can probably not redirect ReleaseTreeimplementation() anymore now that I've done the above, but leaving for now
  till I feel safe and this version has been in the wild a while.



9-8-2015 v111c_Build_005
+ Reworked redirection\detours code to be able to reverse the patching. 
  Basically undid prior method in v003 of patching only once.
  Reworked the entire code so that we a) don't do redirection until map\game load if not already patched,
  b) un-do patching upon unloading map\game to main menu or reloading. c) revert patching upon entering asset editor.
  d) This allows asset-editor to be used while mod is turned on (or at least in my limited testing things seem to work fine now).

+ Turning on and off the plugin does not require a restart of the game, it will unload it's patching and reset things
  when toggled from enabled to disabled. This mean if you still have issues with the Asset Editor you can just
  disable the plugin and re-enter the Asset Editor without having to exit the game.

+ Minor tweak to jury rig and edge case were new maps were getting a -1 tree count (same for new assets) due to itemcount=0. 

+ Added logging option via standard gui options for mods, stored in config file TreeUnlimiterConfig.xml in root
  of CSL steam gamefolder. It's primarly just for debugging during development and unless instructed probably
  should never be needed by typical user, left in the code just in case someone runs into into issues and I need
  them to post a super detailed log.

9-6-2015 v111c_Build_003

- Removed some unneccessary logging for each redirection call, it's was just polluting the log file.
+ Added additional logging for debug purposes but conditioned them to not appear for nomal users.  
+ Added ability for the mod to work in the map editor, seems to work, extensive test not completed.
+ Had to add some code to flush\rebuild the tree buffer after a new-map; unlike game loads, fresh "new maps"
  were retaining trees loaded by a previous 'load map', very wierd.  
- Tried but failed to get the mod while using the asset editor to work right for trees with the mod loaded.
+ Changed rediction code to only fire once per CSL load.. loads on start doesn't fire upon every map load.
+ There were cases where the redirection calls were being called more times then needed, they should in theory now only
  be called once while the mod loads and not on each map load.
+ Assembly Company Name\copyright fields contains build string, done so main assembly ver stamp always
 matches C\O build# for now and a user can right click in windows and see what copy they actually have.


7-1-2015 v111c_Build_001 
Initial updates for CSL 1.1.1c compatibility (few lines added to mirror c\o function updates) nothing major.
