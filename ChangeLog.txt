**ChangeLog**
-----------------------

9-xx-2015 - v1xxx_Build_001 [planned]
Afterdark update and dlc related changes\recompiling planned.


9-8-2015 v111c_Build_005
+ Reworked redirection\detours code to be able to reverse the patching. 
  Basically undid prior method in v003 of patching only once.
  Reworked the entire code so that we a) don't do redirection until map\game load if not already patched,
  b) un-do patching upon unloading map\game to main menu or reloading. c) revert patching upon entering asset editor.
  d) This allows asset-editor to be used while mod is turned on (beta).

+ Turning on and off the plugin does not require a restart of the game, it will unload it's patching and reset things
  when toggled from enabled to disabled. This mean if you still have issues with the Asset Editor you can just
  disable the plugin and re-enter the Asset Editor without having to exit the game.

+ Minor tweak to jury rig and edge case were new maps were getting a -1 tree count (same for new assets). 

+ Added logging option via standard gui options for mods, stored in config file TreeUnlimiterConfig.xml in root
  of CSL steam gamefolder.

9-6-2015 v111c_Build_003

- Removed some unneccessary logging for each redirection call, it's was just polluting the log file.
+ Added additional logging for debug purposes but conditioned them to not appear for nomal users.  
+ Added ability for the mod to work in the map editor, seems to work, extensive test not completed.
+ Had to add some code to flush\rebuild the tree buffer after a new-map; unlike game loads, fresh "new maps"
  were retaining trees loaded by a previous 'load map', very wierd.  
- Tried but failed to get the mod to get the asset editor to work right for trees with the mod loaded.
<<<<<<< HEAD
+ Changed rediction code to only fire once per CSL load.. loads on start doesn't fire upon every map load.
=======
+ There were cases where the redirection calls were being called more times then needed, they should in theory now only
  be called once while the mod loads and not on each map load.
>>>>>>> origin/master
+ Assembly Company Name field contains build string, done so main assembly ver stamp always
 matches C\O build# for now.


7-1-2015 v111c_Build_001 
Initial updates for CSL 1.1.1c compatibility (few lines added to mirror c\o function updates) nothing major.
