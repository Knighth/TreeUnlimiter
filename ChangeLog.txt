9-5-2015 v111c_Build_003

- Removed some unneccessary logging for each redirection call, it's was just polluting the log file.
+ Added additional logging for debug purposes but conditioned them to not appear for nomal users.  
+ Added ability for the mod to work in the map editor, seems to work, extensive test not completed.
+ Had to add some code to flush\rebuild the tree buffer after a new-map; unlike game loads, fresh "new maps"
  were retaining trees loaded by a previous 'load map', very wierd.  
- Tried but failed to get the mod to get the asset editor to work right for trees with the mod loaded.
+ Assembly Company Name field contains build string, done so main assembly ver stamp always
 matches C\O build# for now.
