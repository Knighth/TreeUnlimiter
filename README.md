# Unlimited Trees Mod
A Cities:Skylines(v1.6.2) Mod to enable \ allow 1 million+ trees in a loaded game.

This mod increases the default limit of 262,144 trees to 1,048,571 (or more) in a loaded\new game.
Allows the new limits to be used in the Map or Scenario Editor as well.
Just make sure if you distribute a map that has more than normal amount of trees you make this mod a requirement (if you want them to see all trees).

This mod may cause issues if enabled and trying to use the Asset Editor, however the latest
versions (1.2+) should resolve those issues. If you run into problems
you should disable the mod (turn it off) from the content manager and reload the asset editor.
(a reload of the game itself should not be needed if using the latest build)

Compatible with the After Dark DLC and Disasters DLC patch\updates (version 1.6.0+) of the game.
