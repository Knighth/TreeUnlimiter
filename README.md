# TreeUnlimiter
Cities Skylines v1.1.1c Mod to enable \ allow 1 million trees in a loaded game.

This mod increases the default limit of 262,144 trees to 1,048,571 in a loaded\new game.
Lastest version allows the new limits to be used in the Map Editor as well.

This mod may cause issues if enabled and trying to use the Asset Editor, the latest build
available here makes an attempt to resolve some of those issues. If you run into problems
you should disable the mod (turn it off) from the content manager and reload the asset editor.
(a reload of the game itself should not be needed if using the latest build)
